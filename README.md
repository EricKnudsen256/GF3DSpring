# Playable Demo
In order to play this game, you must have the most recent version of Vulkan installed on your machine. 

On Windows, you should be able to run the game simply by running the gf3d.exe executable file.

On Linux (tested with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS), please navigate to gfc-3/include/Makefile and run the included Makefile using the "make" command. Then, run the Makefile located at include/Makefile in the same way. Once compiled, run the new gf3d file in the main directory. 

I am not sure how you should run this on Mac, since it was made with Vulkan it should be compatible, but I do not have a machine to test this. If anyone knows how to compile this on Mac, please let me know so I can update this README.

The controls are WSAD to move, mouse to look around, Left-Ctrl to crouch, and E to interact with the objects in the environment. The player can hide under the beds, hide in lockers, use the levers on the walls to open and close doors, and interact with vents to move to another vent in the map. In order to win, the player must find the golden exit door and press E to interact with it while standing next to it.

Please feel free to ask me any questions about the code or the game at e.knudsen256@gmail.com. There is also a demo video link in the README of the "Final" branch.
