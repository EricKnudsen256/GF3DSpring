# Horror Game Demo
This game was made during my Vulkan game development course at NJIT. 

A very basic project was provided to the class with just enough code to render a few very simple objects to the scene. All other additions and improvements, such as the first person camera and controller, level generation system, AI monster, and the interactible objects around the environment, were coded and developed by me exclusively.

All rendering was done through Vulkan using HLSL shaders. While a sample rendering pipeline was provided for us, I created a seperate pipeline for the purpose to rendering debug wireframes, and improved on the original pipeline to add in a dynamic lighting system, shown in the demo video.

While there are a ton of additions that I could make to this game, I believe my results were very good, despite the relatively short time frame.
